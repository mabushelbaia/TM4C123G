## To-do:   
Write a C program that changes the color of the onboard LEDs by using the two onboard 
push button keys. When the board is turned on, the onboard LEDs light on in the following 
sequence B -> R -> G. When the right-side key (SW1) is pressed, the onboard LED lights
Yellow at the first click, Magenta at the second click, and Cyan at the third click, so every 
three clicks it should light in this sequence Y -> M -> C. And when the left-side key (SW2) 
is pressed, the onboard LED light is White.
